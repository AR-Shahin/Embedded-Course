# University-Embedded-Course
In this repository, I uploaded a couple of lab experiment codes and a project I've done in my universities **Embedded System course**. For those projects, we have used **Raspberry PI** (version 3) and several types of sensors and actuators, like Ultra Sonic sensors, IR sensors, PIR sensors, Servo Motor, LED lights, Relays, and many more. Finally, We have done a project that **Attendance System using Face Recognition**. 


## The Lab Experiments are  
- LED light blinking
- Distance measure using Ultra Sonic Sensor
- Door Open using Servo Motor
- High Voltage Control using Relay
- PIR Motion Sensor
- IR Module

## Final Project (Attendance System Using Face Recognition)
