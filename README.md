# University-Embedded-Course
In this repository, I uploaded a couple of lab experiment's code and a project that I've done in my universities Embedded System course. For those project, we have used **Raspberry PI** (version 3). We several types of senors and actuators. Like Ultra Sonic sensors, IR sensors, PIR sensors, Servo Motor, LED light, Relay and many more. Finally, We have done a project that **Attendance System using Face Recognition**. 


## The Lab Experiments are  
- LED light blinking
- Distance measure using Ultra Sonic Sensor
- Door Open using Servo Motor
- High Voltage Control using Relay
- PIR Motion Sensor
- IR Module

## Final Project (Attendance System Using Face Recognition)
